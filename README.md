# QueryFusion

**ðŸš€ [Live Demo](https://hamidrezarezaeigithub.github.io/query-fusion/)**

QueryFusion is a Vite-powered React + TypeScript single-page application for exploring JSON and XML documents. It provides a three-panel layout where users can paste or upload content, compose queries, and review results with helpful tooling such as syntax highlighting, validation, and formatting utilities.

The application uses modern web technologies including Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn/ui components for enhanced user interface elements.

## Key Features

- **Dual content support** â€“ Toggle between JSON and XML workflows through the navigation bar; each content type keeps its own content, query, and results using an internal `DefaultContentSpecificMap` store. Content type state is managed through React Context to avoid prop drilling across components.
- **Rich editing experience** â€“ All three panels use Ace Editor with autocompletion, theming, and focus management so keyboard users can quickly switch between the content, query, and result panes.
- **Content validation and formatting** â€“ Validation is handled by the `ContentValidator`, delegating to JSON or XML validators to surface parsing issues in real time. When content is valid, the formatter service can pretty-print it for easier inspection.
- **Query execution services** â€“ Queries are processed client-side via `jsonpath` for JSON documents and `xpath` with `xmldom` for XML. Responses are normalized into `IQueryResponse` objects for consistent rendering.
- **Context-driven state management** â€“ Theme preferences and content type selection use React Context providers, eliminating prop drilling and providing clean separation of concerns.
- **User experience helpers** â€“ Includes dark/light theme switching, GitHub link, and responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components with Font Awesome icons for a modern, accessible interface.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Preview the production build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Deployment

This application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment is handled by a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

### Live Application

The application is available at: **[https://hamidrezarezaeigithub.github.io/query-fusion/](https://hamidrezarezaeigithub.github.io/query-fusion/)**

### Manual Setup Required

To enable GitHub Pages deployment for this repository, you need to configure the following settings in your GitHub repository:

1. **Go to Repository Settings** â†’ Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on **Settings**
2. **Pages Configuration** â†’ In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**
3. **Source Configuration** â†’ Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. **Wait for Deployment** â†’ After pushing to main, the workflow will run automatically. The first deployment may take a few minutes.

### Workflow Details

The deployment workflow:
- Triggers on pushes to `main` branch or manually via workflow dispatch
- Installs dependencies and builds the application
- Creates a `404.html` file (copy of `index.html`) for SPA routing support
- Deploys the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages
- Uses Node.js 18 for consistency

### Local Development vs Production

- **Development**: Run `npm run dev` - application runs at `http://localhost:5173/`
- **Production**: The app is configured with base path `/query-fusion/` in `vite.config.ts` for GitHub Pages
- **Preview Production Build**: Run `npm run preview` to test the production build locally

## Styling Architecture

The application uses modern CSS technologies for styling and components:

### Tailwind CSS
- **Utility-first CSS framework** for rapid development and consistent design
- **Configuration**: `tailwind.config.js` with custom color variables for theming
- **PostCSS integration**: Processes Tailwind directives through `postcss.config.js`
- **CSS variables**: Support for light/dark themes through HSL color variables
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with 2-column layout on wide screens, 1-column on narrow screens

### Shadcn/ui Components  
- **Modern component library** built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind styling
- **Available components**: Button, Switch, Toggle, DropdownMenu (extensible)
- **Configuration**: `components.json` defines paths and styling preferences
- **Utilities**: Custom `cn()` function in `src/lib/utils.ts` for class merging

### Layout Design
- **Navbar**: Fixed at top with logo, content type selector, theme toggle, and GitHub link
- **Wide screens (md+)**: 2-column layout with content panel on left, query/result panels stacked on right
- **Narrow screens**: 1-column layout with all panels stacked vertically
- **FontAwesome icons** integrated for consistent iconography

### Development Workflow
```bash
# The build process includes:
npm run build        # TypeScript compilation + Vite build with Tailwind processing
npm run lint         # ESLint with special rules for ui/ components
npm run dev          # Development server with Tailwind JIT compilation
```

## Testing

No automated test suite is currently defined; feature behavior can be validated manually through the running application.

## To-Do List

To finish the UI-only QueryFusion experience (no accounts, no persistence, and no data collection), work through the following tasks:

1. ~~**Modern styling migration**~~ âœ… **COMPLETED** â€“ Migrated from React Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components with responsive 2-column/1-column layout.
2. **Editor affordances** â€“ Add inline guidance in each editor panel (placeholder text, tooltips, empty-state messaging) to clarify how users can paste/upload content, craft queries, and interpret results without requiring documentation.
3. **Validation feedback** â€“ Enhance the validation messaging area with color, icons, and succinct copy that make JSON/XML issues immediately clear while remaining entirely client-side.
4. **Result visualization** â€“ Provide alternative renderers (tree view for JSON, formatted markup for XML) that help users inspect complex responses without leaving the browser.
5. **Keyboard and screen reader support** â€“ Confirm that focus order, ARIA labels, and skip links enable complete navigation and usage without a mouse.
6. **Sample content shortcuts** â€“ Offer quick actions that populate the editors with demo JSON/XML snippets so users can try the tool instantly while keeping everything local to the session.
7. **In-browser help modal** â€“ Create a lightweight help/about modal summarizing capabilities, privacy assurances (client-only processing, no data storage), and external resources.
8. **Performance review** â€“ Profile the client bundle, eliminating unnecessary dependencies and enabling lazy loading where possible to keep the UI fast.
9. **Manual QA checklist** â€“ Document a manual test pass covering the JSON and XML workflows, theme toggling, formatting, and validationâ€”all within the browser.
10. **Mobile experience enhancement** â€“ Optimize the 1-column layout for mobile devices with improved touch targets and swipe gestures for panel navigation.
11. **Button interaction polish** â€“ Add hover states, loading states, and better disabled state styling for all Shadcn buttons.
12. **Theme consistency** â€“ Ensure all Ace Editor themes properly align with light/dark mode across all panels.
